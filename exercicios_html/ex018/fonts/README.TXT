Kiwi Media Presents...
                         CreepyGirl!

Yes, another pointy, somewhat disturbing font, or in this case a family of
fonts. 

Design by Elly Burian, famed net.goth and quite a creepy girl herself.  

And I'm only asking $10 shareware fee. If you can't manage that, at least
send me some email.  Worldwide adulation and fame and power will work
nicely, thank you very much. 

Contact me at wonko@itis.com for address and billing information.
